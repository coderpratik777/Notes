----------------------JDBC---------------------------------------------
Drivers are the programs that are provide by the mysql to provide the connectivity between the jdbc and the database.
Reflection api- the auto complete help we get in eclipse uses reflection api.


why we use prepared statement insted of statement to fire query from jdbc

so when we use statment every time when the query is fired it compiles it and then execute it ;
but when we use prepared statement it precompiles the query so that it does not compile every time during firing of the 
query.

use executeupdate for dml statements.
correlated subqueries
