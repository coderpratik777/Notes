How to run the java jdbc code using cmd--

we know that java byte codes are residing in bin folder



Setting up the maven for project building--

After downloading Maven ,we need to set the path
--Open environment variables
-in the path ,put the location of apache bin folder

we write javac programs in src/main/java
we write persistence.xml and related files in src/main/resources
compile code of java is store in target folder.
dependencies are store in the pom.xml.

just for demostration we are adding itext library in java which is a java pdf file handler

GAV are identification of the maven project they are groupid ,artifact id,version.

mvn compile  is used to compile the project.
mvn test is used for testing
mvn package -it creates jar file for the project 
java -jar target/my-mave-app-0.0.1-SnapSHOT.jar
--this command gives error beacuse it does not know the main class

To run the main class we have to add some code in the pom.xml to make the jar file clickable 

<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <artifactId>maven-assembly-plugin</artifactId>
      <configuration>
        <archive>
          <manifest>
            <mainClass>fully.qualified.MainClass</mainClass>
          </manifest>
        </archive>
        <descriptorRefs>
          <descriptorRef>jar-with-dependencies</descriptorRef>
        </descriptorRefs>
      </configuration>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <id>make-assembly</id> <!-- this is used for inheritance merges -->
          <phase>package</phase> <!-- bind to the packaging phase -->
          <goals>
            <goal>single</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>

here change the class name.

run the command in the maven project 

java -jar <file directory structure>


-mvn clean : it is use to clean the target folder
