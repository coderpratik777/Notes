Why we use Jpa repository over Crud repository?

In jpa repsository the return type is list which is type of collection and it provides more functionality.

In the JPA repository interface declaration JpaRepository<Book, Long>, the second parameter Long is the
 type of the ID field of the Book entity. It indicates that Book entity has an ID field of type Long, and 
this ID field is used to uniquely identify each instance of the Book entity in the database.

The Long parameter is necessary because Spring Data JPA needs to know the type of the ID field of the entity 
in order to perform various operations like findById, deleteById, and so on. By providing the ID type as a type 
parameter, Spring Data JPA can generate the necessary queries to retrieve or modify entities using their IDs.

For example, if we want to retrieve a Book entity by its ID, we can call the findById method on the BookRepository
 object and pass the ID as an argument: 

@Autowired
private BookRepository bookRepository;

public Book getBookById(Long id) {
    Optional<Book> bookOptional = bookRepository.findById(id);
    return bookOptional.orElseThrow(() -> new RuntimeException("Book not found"));
}


In this example, the id parameter is of type Long and corresponds to the ID field of the Book entity.
 The findById method uses this ID to retrieve the corresponding Book entity from the database.
