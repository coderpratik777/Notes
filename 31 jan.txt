clone method in java


Similar to string pool , a pool of Integer object is created for the range of numbers between -128 to 127;
pooling of numbers is only applicable to integer class
Integer a=100;
Intger b=100;
a==b----->true
a=1000;
b=1000;
a==b----->false


Integer x=10;
x=20;
in the above code we assign x=10 and the obt is made but when we assign x=20 a new object is created again so the wrapper
classes should be use careful
